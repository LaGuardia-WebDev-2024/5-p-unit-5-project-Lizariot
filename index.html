    <h2>Russian music artists</h2>
    <h4>
      <span class="first-sentence">
        Russian music reflects the nation’s cultural and political
        history.</span
      >
      Soviet-era music ranged from state-approved classical works by
      Shostakovich to underground rock bands like Kino, whose frontman Viktor
      Tsoi became a symbol of youthful rebellion with songs like Gruppa Krovi.
      These artists captured the tensions of their time, blending traditional
      Russian motifs with modern influences to create enduring cultural icons.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      <span class="first-sentence">
        Today, Russian music is shaped by both tradition and contemporary
        issues.</span
      >
      Artists like Monetochka and Strykalo mix pop and satire, often addressing
      pressing topics like war and societal discontent. Many, including
      Monetochka, have been labeled “foreign agents” for their outspoken views.
      This reflects a broader trend where music remains a medium for resistance
      and commentary, even under political constraints.

    <h3>"It was in Russia"- by Monetochka(full version, #4 on the playlist)</h3>
    <h5>
      <ol>
        I remember the drizzle as I walked from the cinema, It happened in
        Russia, which means it was long ago. It happened in Russia, which means
        it was in a dream, No one can steal a dream; it will stay with me. I
        remember the drizzle as I walked from the cinema, It happened in Russia,
        which means it was long ago. It happened in Russia, which means it was
        in a dream, No one can steal a dream; it will stay with me.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        And no matter which ticket I buy now, Mine is gone, and my people are
        gone too. No one’s left to meet me with a sign in their hand, And now
        they sing there in another language. It’s so unreachable that dreaming
        is pointless, Every lock is open, but the main one is sealed. I don’t
        feel sad; I don’t want it back, But I hope I won’t forget my blurry
        dream on the way.
      </ol>
    </h5>
